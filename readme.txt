* Invite Tree Stats
See the flow of invites in a tree and manage your userbase in a way it would not be possible without an invite system. If you have a closed community, you can see in the tree where the people come from, and if you have some unwanted people coming into your community, you can see from which user the people got invited and delete the complete tree or make this user as spam, unwanted or fake.

### How it works.
You create the first bunch of invite codes and define how many new Invite Codes get created for a new user. Also, no new invite codes are possible if you want to only invite people without letting them invite their friends. In case you allow your users to invite their friends. The new user gets a list of invite codes and can buy himself invite others. If the friend registers with the invite code, he will again get new invite codes generated and so on. With this technique, you can quickly build a user base of one particular user type.

* Display the  invite codes to invite others in any Page or BuddyPress Profile

* Let your users write a custom invite message or use a predefined message

### Use Cases
